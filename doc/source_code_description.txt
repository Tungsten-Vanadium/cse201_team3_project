Source Code Description: (Jeremy Schuster)

The first class of our project is the Market Class, which is represented by the various html and php web pages,
paired with MySQL. The first web page is the index, which contains links to create a new profile, request an app, login,
and other worth while information. There will also be a php script which pulls the 6 most recent app submissions into a 
panel for quick view. The index links to the 'request an app' page, which contains a php script for communication
to the MySQL server. The user can enter the information and then query the server to store the information. When 
sucessful, the user will be automatically returned to the home page. The user can also access a login and and new user 
pages, which allow the user to query the server through php scripts in two ways. When creating a profile, the user can
submit a form and have it entered into the server. When querying the server to login, the user simply enter's their own
data, and then a php script communicates securely with the server to see if the information is valid. Once logged in, 
a user will be able to access the 'request an app' page and eventually comment and rate apps.

The Market Class contains applications, which are represented visually in the market by boxes containing the info, and 
in code in a MySQL table on the server. 

The User class is also represented as a MySQL table, with the Admin and Mod classes, being inhertied from the user class,
represented by a null value columni in the table. When the value is not null, the user will be able to see and execute the
commands for each class respectively.

The Review class is represented by the comment and rate features, which are not currently added. However, they will
eventually be a separate button off of each app which allows the user to visit the comment and rating age for an app,
and optionally submit thir own comment.
