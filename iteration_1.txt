Iteration 1

Our Iteration 1 will showcase our running Apache server with minimal functionality. We will show
a shell of the webpage created in HTML. We will be presenting a few demo apps which can be seen with 
limited functionality. Application functionality will be expanded in later iterations. We will show 
a search bar with an engine which is ready to implement, but currently connected to the database. 
We will have introductory documentation written, outlining what our project does. Finally, we will 
have shells of several forms written which are not yet linked to the server, but can accept data.
