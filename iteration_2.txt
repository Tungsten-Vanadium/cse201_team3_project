Iteration 2

Our Iteration 2 will showcase our updated website with a functioning application submission form. Users will be able
to submit an application, which is autmatically approved until the next iteration when Admin and Mod accounts are set up.
The search bar will be functional for title and description queries of existing apps. The applications will be stored
in a SQL database with PHP working in the background to communicate with the website. Users will be able to log in to 
a user account, but the Admin and Mod titles will not yet be created. The user information will be stored in a secure 
section of a separete SQL database.
